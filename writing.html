									<h3>Dancing Sparks of Peppermint</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									<i>A descriptive essay for AP Lang, written senior year of high school.</i><br><br>

									The mattress was soft but sturdy, and the tension from the springs pushed back against my elbow as I shifted my weight to the other side. I was curled up in a fetal position, clutching the sky blue comforter close to myself, the warmth of the fabric spreading from my chest to my toes. Using my damp hair as a pillow, I rested my head at the edge of the mattress, the green apple shampoo casting a spell of cool sweetness into the air. I closed my eyes and listened to the crisp click of the keys as he typed away, muttering Java code to himself as his fingers tap-danced on the keyboard. With my vision still engulfed in an endless world of black, I reached out my hand from the home of the comforter, blindly searching for something to hold onto. The clicks paused and I suddenly felt soft flesh pressing against my own, his fingers interlocked with mine. My fingers slid downward until they hit the bottom of the crevice, sinking in place as one puzzle piece fit into another. Pressure from his smooth fingers strangled mine, and a soft thud from the roots of my fingers interrupted the silence each time a pulse ran through. An East Coast summer humidity began to grow from the center of my palms, crawling toward my fingertips, expanding the wet heat.<br><br>
									My eyes snapped open. He was staring at me, his pupils like two cups filled to the brim with dark coffee, shimmering in the afternoon light that peeked in from the blinded window. His lips, pink clouds resting against a sky of gold, trembled as a gloveless skier in a snowstorm; it was a tremble of fright, confusion, and awe. The clicks had ceased altogether and a deathly silence filled the room, only to be broken by the crescendo of accelerating drums that pounded violently in my head. Our breathing became synchronized, and with each inhale, cedar wood cologne mixed into my green apple, creating a fusion of sweet and spice much like cinnamon.<br><br>
									His coffee eyes were closer now, and as his shaking lips moved toward my frozen body, his warm breath slowly melted the ice that had locked my body in place. From the core of my spine, a fire emerged and spread, dampening the back of my neck and the creases of my hands with beads of perspiration. While the dark coffee grew, the surrounding room blurred and eventually disappeared into the radiance of the tinted sunlight. The green apple vanished, and I gently let go of the blanket as the cedar wood forced me deeper into the mattress. Then it was all peppermint. As my eyelids shut with an almost inaudible thud, I felt the lashes tickle the skin underneath my eyes. Lights flickered twice and once again my world was black.<br><br>
									In the darkness of my own stage, colored lights danced. The opening act was a bright highlighter pink, a brilliant shade of rose. Following closely was a Tahiti lagoon, a mixture of turquoise and pine green. Fireworks flared as colors dashed across the stage, sending sparks that glistened in the silence. The sparks were everywhere. Starting in my chest, my heart shot them out like blood, sending them through my veins in all directions. As they reached the tips of my fingers, explosions petrified my hands, and as they raced to my toes, my feet became numb. I danced with the lights and the sparks. I drowned in peppermint. The green apple became cedar wood and for a moment in time, our lips were one.

									<h3>Saratoga High Interchapter</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									<i>A reflection on my high school experience, written junior year of high school.</i><br><br>

									The students come from all directions - the McAfee center, the swimming pool, the football field, the parking lot. They scurry through the campus, ants scavenging for food near an anthill, bumping into one another, making a careless apology, and continuing on their way. The burden of a backpack, filled with AP textbooks and history notes, drags the students down as they rush to their classes. Some students also carry musical instruments and sports rackets, and these go bouncing on their backs through the parking lot, through the quad, through the halls, through the doors.<br><br>
									Sometimes a few students will move away from the massive crowd and sit on a bench. But they are not resting; they are talking. They talk about the homework, the teachers, the boys and the girls. They complain about the homework, the teachers, the boys and the girls. They complain about the crowd that they mingle with everyday. They hate the crowd, but they cannot do anything about it – they are a part of the crowd, and they will be a part of the crowd for four years. They hate the homework, but they do it anyway. They hate the tests, but they study anyway. They hate the popular clique, but they want to be a part of it anyway. They hate themselves because they cannot do anything about it. They hate each other for not doing anything about it.<br><br>
									When the bell rings for lunch, the students rush into the quad, pouring out of the classrooms like an unleashed flood, drowning the halls with backpacks and textbooks. They cling to each other like blind rats, one guiding the other, without knowing where they are going. They tell themselves they are going into the future – a future consisting of an Ivy League university, a multimillion-dollar mansion, and a successful, prosperous family. They tell themselves that they are on this path, and they tell themselves that they can see how it all plays out. But they cannot see. They cannot see the blue sky dotted with cotton candy clouds nor the purple flowers in the quad nor the tears in their classmate’s hazel eyes nor the cuts on their best friend’s arms. They cannot see nor smell nor feel nor hear the music of life. They only see their weekly planners, their SAT prep books, and their Aeries homepage. They only see themselves.<br><br>
									Occasionally, a student will open her eyes and look up at the blue sky dotted with cotton candy clouds and the purple flowers in the crowd. Occasionally, a student will gaze into her classmate’s hazel eyes. She has broken the spell. She pushes herself out of the bubble that keeps her from seeing anything but herself. She actually cares about something, feels something. She reaches out to other people, gives her heart to those she loves. She surprises her friends with cake, with flowers, with a teddy bear, with a hug. She gives up her time to talk to someone who needs her. She is happy because everything is beautiful at that moment. But the moment never lasts. Slowly, her happiness fades away, as those around her return her beautiful smile with menacing glares. The crowd starts to talk about her. The crowd does not like her smile. The crowd hates her smile. The crowd kills her smile.<br><br>
									The student returns to her blindness, where she is safe and at home.<br><br>
									The student joins the others coming in from all directions - the McAfee center, the swimming pool, the football field, the parking lot. They scurry through the campus, ants scavenging for food near an anthill, bumping into one another, making a careless apology, and continuing on their way.
